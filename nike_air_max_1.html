      Nike Air Max 1

    In some respects, 1987 was a great year for entertainment and culture. 
    Aretha Franklin became the first woman inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 
    The Simpsons made its first television appearance, Michael Jackson released Bad and 
    Nike released the inaugural Air Max sneaker, the Air Max 1. These moments would all go on to be hugely 
    influential and each one's revolutionary character lives on today.
    For Nike, the Air Max 1 went down in history as a pivotal and innovative 
    design that elevated the brand when they needed it most. Although the story 
    is part of sneaker lore, its 30th birthday—also known as Air Max Day—is approaching 
    and as Nike dedicates an entire month to its celebration with more releases than we can keep 
    track of, we're taking a look back at how the Air Max revolution started.

    It’s a story that can’t be told without first introducing renowned designer Tinker Hatfield. 
    In 1981, long before becoming sneaker industry royalty, Nike hired Hatfield as a corporate architect 
    to design buildings on the brand’s Oregon campus. It wasn’t until four years later, in 1985, that he 
    would begin designing footwear upon request. He applied his architectural background to sneaker design 
    and it didn’t take long for him to impart a rebellious spirit into the recently struggling brand. “I began 
    working on a renegade set of shoes that were not part of a design brief or marketing drive,” he explains, 
    referencing what would become the very first Air Max sneaker.

    The ‘80s started well for Nike, they’d acquired 50% market share in the U.S. athletic shoe market and were on track 
    to become a one billion dollar company. However, midway through the decade, the competition was creeping up on them. 
    Bright colors, daring patterns and bold neons embellished the era, and Nike needed something more striking. Nike's Cortez, 
    Waffle Racer and Tailwind had proved popular in the past but they didn't capture the experimental nature of the time. 
    Hatfield saw the importance of risk taking and a trip to Paris would provide the catalyst for a brightly burning idea...
    Nike’s Air technology wasn’t new; it was developed by former NASA engineer Frank Rudy and introduced in the Air Tailwind in 1978. 
    Air replaced traditional molded EVA soles with gas filled urethane pouches. However, it was the consensus that as performance 
    technology the pouches ought to be felt and not seen. That was until Hatfield came along.
